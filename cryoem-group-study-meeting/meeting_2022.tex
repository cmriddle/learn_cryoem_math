\section{General Information}

\subsection{Archived material}

Meetings from 2020-2021 are archived \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/blob/master/cryoem-group-study-meeting/meeting.pdf}{here}. The audience was a mix of beginners and advanced practitioners, and computational methods developers. 

\subsection{Audience and Streams}

Feel free to share this document and direct people to sign up at \url{https://forms.gle/BUeUW14vV4pyQbDDA} so I have the emails in one place. Online meeting links are emailed to those on this list. {\bf Please join the Slack group and ask questions there, rather than emailing me.}

\subsection{Audience}
In 2022, I am catering to a computational methods development audience. I see this group as a way for computational methods developers to get together in a "pre-competitive" learning environment.

{\bf Practitioners $\rightarrow$ computational methods developers}: You are a structural biologist, or biochemist, and perhaps an advanced cryo-EM practitioner. You would like to train in computational methods development, either to do very advanced data processing, or develop your own methods.

{\bf Pure computational discipline $\rightarrow$ cryo-EM computational methods developers}: You have a background in computer science (computer vision, deep learning, statistics, electrical/computer engineering) and would like to develop methods for the "killer application" of cryo-EM.

\subsection{Pre-requisites}
The bar is quite high, and this group is not for all. There are very good resources out there for self-study; see this \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/blob/master/README.md}{annotated a bibliography}. If you have done an undergraduate degree in an advanced computational program (physics, chemistry, computer science, statistics, applied math) or are a PhD student in a computational field, then you are in good company in this group.

\subsection{Scope}

\subsubsection{Math / Computer science}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item amortized inference, model learning
	\item physics aware/inspired/infused deep learning
	\item deep learning of the image formation model (rotation, etc)
	\item computationally modelling uncertainty in the image formation model
	\item geometric deep learning and invariance/equivariance in cryo-EM
	\item computational optimal transport
	\item computational differential geometry
	\item optimization
	\item custom GPU kernels, including gradient for backprop/autodiff
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Physics}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Electron optics
	\item Higher order CTF aberrations
	\item Multi-slice
	\item Sample damage
	\item Detector physics
	\item Solvation
	\item Poisson-Boltzmann equation
	\item Modelling choices to encode coulombic density
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Meeting Format}
The meetings are meant to be more informal that is typical in research talks. The point is to learn and discuss with other learners, experienced practitioners, and experts. They are also more comprehensive than typical journal clubs. We may stick with a papers or series of papers for multiple weeks to sufficiently learn the material.

\subsection{Slack}
We will use the Slack channel 'cryoem\_study\_group' for asynchronous chat. Please join the Slack group and ask questions there, rather than emailing me. You can request a link to join by emailing me.

\subsection{Testimonials}

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\it Shayan Shekarforoush, PhD student with Marcus Brubaker and David Fleet, Jan 2021}. I joined this reading group in mid October and I wish I would have done so much earlier. Although I joined when the group was in the middle of reading a fascinating, recently published book in Single-Particle cryoEM, everyone was so welcome that I did not feel I am way behind others. My background is in CS and I do research as a method developer in this field. With that said, I learned a lot from discussions of people with expertise in experimental side of this area. I believe that this group helped me to build a better intuition and now I feel more comfortable with the underlying math and physics of this topic. This group also provided the opportunity to attend talks of prominent researchers in cryoEM where anyone could openly ask their questions and have clear discussions. Looking forward to having more collaborations with the members of this group.
\end{itemize}

\section{Learning Resources}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item A good place to start is Grant Jensen's \href{https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/grant-jensen-cryo-em}{popular} online course \href{https://jensenlab.caltech.edu/courses/}{'Getting Started in Cryo-EM' }.

	\item After getting up to speed on the prerequisites, another good next step is the content developed by Dr Frederick Sigworth and others at \url{https://cryoemprinciples.yale.edu/video-lectures}. If you are having problems with links, then try viewing his content on YouTube.

	\item  Also, I highly recommend the interactive learning material developed by \href{http://cryoem.tudelft.nl/group/arjen-jakobi/}{Arjen Jakobi}, for a course on \href{https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/aj-lab/teaching/-/wikis/NB4020}{High-Resolution Imaging at TUDelft}: "The practicals are computational assignments in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks hosted in a virtual learning environment. These notebooks contain code that can be executed to perform certain tasks or visualize results; you do not need any active knowledge of coding to work through the notebook." For the curious, the code that generates the visualizations is available on the repository.
 
	\item I have made an annotated bibliography organized thematically \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math#resources}{here}.

	\item Coding notebooks to play around with are \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/tree/master/nb}{here}. If there is incompatibility between the notebook and the \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/tree/master/src}{code base} in the repo, that is because the code base has been updated. Older version of the code are available via past commits.
